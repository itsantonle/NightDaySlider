# NightDaySlider
Bootstrap powered with Sass and JS DOM. Still an idea and work in progress.  Bootstrap sliders that change the text and background of a card to dark and light mode. I might add a CSS animation. 
TO DO:
- start on HTML
- start on SASS
- write JS preferably use TSC

a mini project to review SASS and TSC with BOOTSTRAP 5
